# Notion JS

Notion JS is a simple wrapper for Notion unofficial API.
It exposes methods to get users, pages, collection, collection views, and spaces.

## Getting Started

To use this, you will need to add a `.env` file to your top directory.
This file should include your Notion token_v2, which you can find by looking at the cookies on any Notion page while logged in.

## To Do
